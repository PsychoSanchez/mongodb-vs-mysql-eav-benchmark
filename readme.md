# MongoDB vs MySQL EAV benchmark

This is a benchmark of MongoDB vs MySQL for EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) data model. 

It tests bulk insert operations and get by entity id queries for 100000 entities with 100 attributes each.

Both MongoDB and MySQL are running in Docker containers, gateway is a Node.js app running fastify.

Test runs autoncannon requests from 100 connections over 30 seconds on a 2022 Macbook Pro M1 with 32GB RAM.

## Setup

- Install docker and docker-compose.
- Install nodejs dependencies: `nvm use && npm install`

## Run

-   Start benchmark with `npm start`
-   Update README.md by running `npm run update-readme`

## Results
